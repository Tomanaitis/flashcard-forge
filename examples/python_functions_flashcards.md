Q1: What is a higher-order function in Python?
A1: A function that takes another function as an argument, returns a function as a result, or both.

Q2: Explain the difference between `*args` and `**kwargs`.
A2: `*args` passes a variable number of non-keyword arguments as a tuple, `**kwargs` passes keyword arguments as a dictionary.

Q3: What is a lambda function and what are its limitations?
A3: An anonymous, small, restricted function definable inline. It is limited to a single expression.

Q4: How do you define a default value for a function parameter?
A4: By assigning a value to the parameter in the function definition (e.g., `def func(param=value):`).

Q5: What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a function?
A5: To exit the function and optionally return a value to the caller. If omitted, it returns `None`.

Q6: How can you use function annotations in Python?
A6: Annotations are metadata attached to function arguments and return values using the `:` and `->` symbols. They are stored in the `__annotations__` attribute.

Q7: What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?
A7: A function is a standalone block of code. A method is a function that is associated with an object.

Q8: Explain what closures are in Python.
A8: A closure is a function object that remembers values in enclosing scopes even if they are not present in memory.

Q9: How do you document a Python function using docstrings?
A9: By including a multiline string literal as the first statement inside the function definition.

Q10: What are decorators in Python, and how do they work?
A10: Decorators are syntactic sugar to wrap a function with another function, modifying its behavior. They use the `@` symbol.
