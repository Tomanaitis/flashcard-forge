Q1: What is the difference between a variable and a constant?
A1: A variable's value can change during program execution, while a constant's value remains fixed.

Q2: Explain the purpose of an 'if-else' statement in programming.
A2: It executes one block of code if a condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false.

Q3: What are the three basic control structures in programming?
A3: Sequence, selection (if-else), and iteration (loops).

Q4: Define "data type" and provide three common examples.
A4: A data type specifies the kind of value a variable can hold. Examples: integer, string, boolean.

Q5: What is the role of comments in source code?
A5: To explain code, improve readability, and are ignored by the compiler/interpreter.

Q6: Explain the difference between syntax and semantics in programming.
A6: Syntax is the rules for writing code; semantics is the meaning of the code. Syntax errors prevent compilation/execution, while semantic errors cause unexpected behavior.

Q7: What is an algorithm?
A7: A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.

Q8: What is debugging, and why is it important?
A8: Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors (bugs) in code. It's important for ensuring that software functions correctly.
