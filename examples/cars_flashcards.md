Q1: What is the function of a catalytic converter in a car?
A1: To reduce toxic pollutants in exhaust gas by converting them into less harmful substances.

Q2: Explain the difference between a car's horsepower and torque.
A2: Horsepower measures the rate at which work is done, while torque measures the rotational force. Torque is generally felt at lower RPMs.

Q3: What is the purpose of an anti-lock braking system (ABS)?
A3: To prevent wheel lockup during braking, allowing the driver to maintain steering control.

Q4: Describe how a turbocharger works.
A4: It forces more air into the engine's cylinders, increasing power. It uses exhaust gases to spin a turbine which then spins a compressor to force more air in.

Q5: What are the advantages of using synthetic motor oil over conventional oil?
A5: Better performance at extreme temperatures, improved engine protection, longer oil change intervals.

Q6: Explain the basic operation of a car's suspension system.
A6: It cushions the ride, keeps the tires in contact with the road, and maintains vehicle stability through the use of springs, dampers, and linkages.

Q7: What is the function of a car's differential?
A7: It allows the wheels on an axle to rotate at different speeds, which is necessary when turning.

Q8: Describe the function of a car's ECU (Engine Control Unit).
A8: It's a computer that controls various aspects of the engine's operation, such as fuel injection, ignition timing, and emissions control.
