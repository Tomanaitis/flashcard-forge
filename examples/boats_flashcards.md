Q1: What is the primary difference between a displacement hull and a planing hull?
A1: Displacement hulls move through the water by pushing it aside, while planing hulls rise up and glide on top of the water at higher speeds.

Q2: Explain the function of a bilge pump on a boat.
A2: A bilge pump removes accumulated water from the lowest interior compartment of the hull, preventing flooding and maintaining buoyancy.

Q3: Describe what cavitation is in relation to a boat propeller, and why it's undesirable.
A3: Cavitation is the formation of vapor bubbles on the propeller blades due to low pressure. It reduces propeller efficiency, causes noise and vibration, and can damage the propeller.

Q4: What is the purpose of a boat's rudder?
A4: The rudder is used to steer the boat by changing the direction of water flow past the hull, allowing the boat to turn.

Q5: What is a keel and what are its main functions?
A5: The keel is a structural extension below the hull, often weighted, that provides stability, reduces leeway (sideways drift), and houses ballast.

Q6: Differentiate between a "beam" and "draft" of a boat.
A6: "Beam" refers to the width of the boat at its widest point, while "draft" is the vertical distance from the waterline to the lowest point of the keel or hull.

Q7: What are the key advantages of using a diesel engine in a boat compared to a gasoline engine?
A7: Diesel engines are generally more fuel-efficient, more durable, and have a lower risk of explosion compared to gasoline engines.

Q8: Explain the term "freeboard" in boating.
A8: Freeboard is the vertical distance from the waterline to the upper deck edge of the boat; a higher freeboard generally provides better protection from waves and spray.
